      <description>It has been almost two years since the original writer of this blog post passed away. I haven&amp;rsquo;t met anyone that&amp;rsquo;s remotely more genuine than him. Return if Possible Mohit.

It is 12:44 in the morning and I donâ€™t feel like sleeping. There were those time in my life where I felt really low and I felt like I had nothing left in me.</description>
