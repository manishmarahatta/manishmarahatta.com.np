I am not a voracious reader. I usually buy books and stack them, until I'm completely free(internet breakage). I usually pick the most recommended books from notable figures. I'm higly into business process. So usually read books related to finance, business, startup processes, team building, leadership, economics and many more related genres. This section Consists of the book I'm reading currently and it's review.

Iâ€™ve marked books that I enjoyed reading in <span class="bookshelf-book-green">green</span> and those that I highly recommend reading in <span class="bookshelf-book-red">red</span>. If you'd like to suggest me a book, please drop me [a message](mailto:me@manishmarahatta.com.np)
