Mujō (無常) means ‘impermanence’ in Japanese. Mujō is the same as anicca(अनिच्चा/अनित्य), the word for ‘impermanence’ in Pāli. Everything within our life is constantly changing and we can be certain that nothing is permanent. Letting go of attachments can bring some level of continuous flow within our life.
