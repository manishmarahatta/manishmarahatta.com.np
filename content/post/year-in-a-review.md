Tomorrow is January 1st, 2018.
I sit here today, on New Years Eve, in a state of reflection as I look back on the past 365 days.
I am thinking about how fast and slow this year has gone. About how much has changed.

I’ll start with my last, but most important reason, and that is to sincerely give a big thank you.
A thank you to my family, my love, my friends (new + old), my mentors, classmates, coworkers, enemies, and everyone who stood before, with, and against me. Thank you for making 2017 an incredible year.


# Things I learned and hopefully you can take away from this story:

* Love is Everything
* Saying no is fucking hard
* Distracted and excused everything by so called “startup”
* Do only one thing really well
* Help people for free whenever you can

# Flashback to 2017

* Felt present. Used social media/phone significantly less. Began to really appreciate the little things in life.
* Tried a ton of new food. Liked most of it.
* Created multiple product that generated revenue, but failed eventually.
* Lost my Dearest Friend.
* Read almost 11 books. My favorite was Sophie’s World. Also listened to a ton of podcasts (Revisionist History and The Engineers).
* Started my weekly newsletter in my workplace.
* Met a guy at Ventures Cafe who even decided to fund my startup, but didn’t pass the green.
* Had to quit the best possible job in the history of workspace.
* Shifted to the worst working place, made my life even worst.
* Met few good peoples: Pankaj, Jenish
* Found the Love of my life.
* Had planned to launch a company but couldn’t.
* Started to live green life.
* Sold Scooter to buy a Cycle.
* Started walking wherever I could.
* Started cooking with a electric stove.

that's it...

I hope you (and your family/friends) have had a healthy, fulfilling year.
I wish you the best in 2018. Dream big for 2018 because this next year is going to be the best.
