These are a bunch of tweets when love/life happened. Curated into one blog post it contains only some part of it.



```I can't see you cry, I can't see you go mad, I can't see you the way you are right now, hummingbird go fly, you're mine, only a memory, collective stack, collective pieces of puzzles i couldn't solve, you'll always be my ghost underlying my shadow```

```A move, a bold move that i lost the first day that we met, it's all the game of queen my darling, it's just a game of consequences, it's a filthy game where the mind and soul belongs here but heart belongs to someone else, it's alright my darling, it's alright```

```all that it remains is the questions, was she a mystery? a chaos in an order? was she a poet in an audience-less shaft? the light shown below in the pond? was it the true light, was it the light of enlightenment, the confession, the provocation, the confrontation```

```was it all a plain lie? lie that collapsed against the mountain and wondered wasn't i traveling from a trench? was it a sudden lie my darling, sipping your sweetest of nectars and wishing to live thereby forever? well it was a game, well it was a game```

```it was a game of love, a mystery, a profound game of queens, a game that i would have won if your heart were here, but isn't it the mind and your soul that regulates the heart, the jurisdiction the mind does, the fulfillness the mind does, you're away, you're away from my behold```

```i was waiting, waiting for something that would never happen, waiting the one that would never come, you broke me, you broke my everything, you broke my life, the fulfillness, the emptiness with you as a ghost scares me, the you who held me up high```

```i was flying in love, in rejoice, in peace, in life, but i didn't let you live nor leave, every-time you walked out, away, away from everything, away from me, i was lost, gazed until you turned back, big breath hoping you're there, you're there close to my heart```

```i feel like laughing, laughing cause i was the clown, i was a fool who fell in love my dear, in love with you, i feel like crying because all i had was you and you're there but still, are you?```

```i stopped waiting, waiting long before you even explained about the "here", "there", and "let me live", i stopped worrying, this was not the love i was aware of, this was not the love i was hoping for, how could it be, this was you```

```you were there when i was about to give up, you were there when i was not sure about anything, you were there to kiss the old memories i had, you were there to make me wonder what love is what life is```

```i remember the first kiss, the kiss that made me realize i was in love with you, the kiss that shivered me, the cold breeze into my heart from your heart, my love wasn't it something, wasn't it something that i took your cold, that i took your cold heart, that i took your shiver```

```that i held those cold hands trying to make it warm, that i felt your lips and whispered "i'll never let you go", that i whispered you kiss perfectly, that i knew it was the beginning, that i knew it was the end, the end of my life, my dear didn't you poisoned me with your nectar```

```i am loosing my faith, loosing my faith on what is real and what is not, loosing my faith on everything i hold behold, did i learned to let go? did i learned how to not expect? did i learned to never trust?```

```weren't you the only reason i was happy, you had seen me before, didn't you noticed the bloom, didn't you notice your hands were warmer than before, didn't you gazed into those brown eyes and found poetry?```

```you were a conundrum to me and to all you dearly know, you're a mystic, you were my confidant, you were my confidant until you hilariously explained what i did as a kid just for the sake of laughter, a vile laughter```

```a laughter which i tried bringing on you, a laughter that you stole it away from me, a laughter that was so precious, for a glimpse of it, didn't i tried ripping my heart out, didn't i tried helding you up high, didn't i tried reflecting my memories into you, my darling```

```how could you not understand the love, the life, the here, the there, the being, the living, didn't you go beautiful places for the sake of love, finding love, was the love finding quest so subtle that you broke my heart into pieces before destroying yours```

```we were sorted out differently, two different chambers in the palace of beautiful mind and souls, were others so wise that you couldn't figure it, open your eyes, open your eyes my darling, see the love, the life, the here, the there, the being, the living```

```me being there, existing, surviving, fighting, thriving, developed a loathe in you my dear, a loathe never to be healed, loathe so rooted that it would never make anything the same, everything was a hoax, a circumstance that changed everything forever, forever my dear```

```with a blink of an eye you came, with a blink of an eye you were someone else, with a blink of an eye you vanished, vanished away into someone else's wiser mind```

```someone who'll never respect you the way i did, someone who'll never be by your side like i was, someone who'll never held you up high, someone who'll never respect your behavior like i did, someone who would never love you the way i do, someone who is later but better than me```

```that someone whose drinking game and black images changed your way of thinking, your way of loving, your way of falling for him, it was all a sympathetic art my dear, you’re too naive to understand, you’re to naive to believe that mine was false and someone’s was true```
