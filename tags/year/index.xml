      <description>Tomorrow is January 1st, 2018. I sit here today, on New Years Eve, in a state of reflection as I look back on the past 365 days. I am thinking about how fast and slow this year has gone. About how much has changed.
Iâ€™ll start with my last, but most important reason, and that is to sincerely give a big thank you. A thank you to my family, my love, my friends (new + old), my mentors, classmates, coworkers, enemies, and everyone who stood before, with, and against me.</description>
